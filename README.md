## About me

Hi there ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™m Kc Sean Brix D. Calinao, aspiring to be a full stack Web Developer with a keen eye for quality and a deep understanding of the web ecosystem, I build solutions that are not only functional but also delightful. Besides my 9to5, I love to give back to the community by blogging, speaking, and open-sourcing my ideas. My love for community led me to Google Developer Expert for Android. If Iâ€™m not crafting app/library then probably wondering about the universeâ€™s existence.

## Get in touch :coffee:
